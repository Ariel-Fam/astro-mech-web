    description:
      "Channels stored energy from the Amethyst Core into a concentrated beam or shockwave. The beam can be tuned: a narrow high-intensity lance for piercing targets, or a wide pulse for crowd control that disrupts electronics and knocks enemies back.",

    name: "Crystal Aegis Shield",
    description:
      "Forms a semi-transparent barrier of hard-light shaped by amethyst resonance. The shield absorbs incoming force and converts part of it into usable charge, briefly strengthening the core and enabling a counter-blast if the character holds the shield long enough.",

    name: "Amethyst Phase Shift",
    description:
      "Momentarily shifts the character’s body into a “crystal-phase” state, letting them pass through thin obstacles or dodge attacks with a flicker-like movement. Each phase shift consumes a large chunk of stored energy; repeated use risks overheating the core and causing violet crackling around the gemstone.",

  },
  {
    name: "Amethyst Core",
    description:
      "Your character’s power comes from an amethyst gemstone core that acts like a living battery. In the lore, amethyst stores ambient energy (cosmic radiation, electromagnetic fields, and emotional/mental “psi” resonance) inside a crystalline lattice, then releases it in controlled pulses. The deeper the violet saturation and clarity, the higher the energy capacity; fractures create unstable surges that can temporarily boost output but risk overload.",
